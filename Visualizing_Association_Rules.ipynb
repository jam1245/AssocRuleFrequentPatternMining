For a set of m rules we can calculate the **m(m − 1)/2** distances and use them as the input for clustering. However, using clustering on the itemsets directly has several problems. First of all, data sets typically mined for association rules are high-dimensional, i.e., contain many different items. This high dimensionality is carried over to the mined rules and leads to \"curse of dimensionality\" where, due to the exponentially increasing volume, distance functions lose their usefulness. The situation is getting worse since minimum support used in association rule mining leads in addition to relatively short rules resulting in extremely sparse data.
